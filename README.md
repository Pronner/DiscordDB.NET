# DiscordDB.NETâ„¢
DiscordDB.NET is an open-source .NET Discord Database Server software that views discord servers as database spaces for you to store, retrieve data. This is a very unique and efficient concept for trafficking data quickly and safely.

However, you may not think this may be safe when it comes to **keeping the data stored**. Since the **DiscordAPI does not allow viewing/editing messages older than 14 days**, we've decided to create a system that renews messages (resends message) **every 12 hours.** Therefore, your data will not be lost.

This **SaaS** is currently free, we do not ask for anything in return. However, in future updates we may start limiting features and turn this into a **Freemium SaaS Application**.

This is a **C#, C++, VB .NET** version of the original **DiscordDB** which is being created by my friend [jamie105](https://github.com/jamie105). You're able to use **DiscordDB.NET** on C#, C++, VB (as long as you use .NET). This project uses **Discord.NET** and Discord Bots to create a working database system.
